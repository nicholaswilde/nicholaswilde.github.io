# Project Workflow

## Project Configuration

- **Required Test Coverage:** >80%
- **Commit Frequency:** After each phase
- **Task Summary Location:** Git Notes

## Project Structure

- **`docker/`**: Docker applications. Use `.template` for new apps.
- **`docs/`**: Markdown documentation (Applications, Tools, Hardware).
- **`lxc/`**: Proxmox LXC application configurations.
- **`pve/`**: Proxmox VE cluster management and specific node configs.
- **`scripts/`**: Bash and Python automation scripts.
- **`vm/`**: Virtual Machine configurations.

## Scaffolding & New Applications

### Docker Applications

1. **Copy Template:** Copy `docker/.template` to a new directory.
2. **Update Environment:** Fill in `.env.tmpl` (CONTAINER_NAME, database credentials).
3. **Configure Compose:** Update `compose.yaml` (service name, image version).
4. **Finalize:** Remove `.j2` extensions after substitution.

### Proxmox LXC Applications

1. **Research & Reference:**
    - Before creating a new LXC, search [community-scripts](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/tree/main/install) for a corresponding installation script.
    - If found, use the script as the primary reference for installation, configuration, and dependencies.
    - If no community script exists, search for the application's official documentation or community installation guides.
2. **Scaffolding:** Copy `lxc/.template` to `lxc/<app_name>`.
3. **Environment:** Update `Taskfile.yml` (SERVICE_NAME, INSTALL_DIR, CONFIG_DIR).
4. **Provisioning:**
    - Use `list_templates` to select `debian-trixie`.
    - Use `pct create` with `--unprivileged 0`, `--net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,ip=dhcp,ip6=slaac`, and `--features nesting=1`.
    - Use `--password $(pass show default-lxc-password)`.
5. **Post-Setup:**
    - Install `openssh-server` and `syncthing`.
    - Purge `cloud-init`.
    - Update `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
        - Set `PermitRootLogin yes`.
        - Ensure `PubkeyAuthentication yes`.
    - Enable and start `syncthing@root` service.
    - Restart SSH service.
    - **Note:** Do not create a default user; use root with the password from `pass`.
6. **Network & Routing:**
    - **Traefik:** Create Traefik config in `pve/traefik/conf.d/`.
    - **DNS:** Add AdGuard Home DNS rewrite.
    - **Syncthing:**
        - Retrieve Device ID: `pct exec <vmid> -- syncthing --device-id`.
        - Add device to host: Use `syncthing_manage_devices` with `action: "add"`, `device_id`, and `name`.
    - **Dashboards:**
        - Add to Homepage dashboard in `pve/homepage/config/services.yaml`.
        - Add to Gatus dashboard in `lxc/gatus/config.yaml.enc` (decrypt/edit/encrypt).
    - **Finalize:** Execute `/homepage update`, `/traefik update`, and `/gatus update` to sync and refresh services.

## Common Commands

Use `task` to run common operations defined in `Taskfile.yml`.

- `task build`: Build the documentation site using Zensical.
- `task serve`: Start the documentation development server (default port 8000).
- `task lint`: Run all linters (Yamllint, Markdownlint, Linkcheck).
- `task markdownlint`: Run only Markdownlint.
- `task yamllint`: Run only Yamllint.
- `task linkcheck`: Check for broken links in documentation.
- `task generate-docs-nav`: Regenerate the MkDocs navigation.
- `markitdown`: Use this CLI command to convert any file to Markdown.

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`.
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation.
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality.
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules.
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience and documentation clarity.
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools.
7. **Scripting Excellence:**
    - **Bash:** Use ShellCheck, 2-space indentation, `function` keyword, and Upper Case constants. Scripts must handle errors (`set -e`, `set -o pipefail`) and use a standard logging function with Catppuccin Mocha colors.
    - **Python:** Strict PEP 8 compliance, 4-space indentation, type hints, and modularity. Use `f-strings` and comprehensive docstrings.
8. **Documentation Standards:** Adhere strictly to the Zensical/MkDocs style guide (headings with emojis, relative links, standard sections, and Material design principles).

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order.

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`.

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for the task.
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase.

5. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing the external behavior.
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools.
   Target: >80% coverage for new code. The specific tools and commands will vary by language and framework.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation.
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with new design.
   - Add dated note explaining the change.
   - Resume implementation.

8. **Stage Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Do not commit yet; changes will be committed at the end of the phase.

9. **Draft Task Summary:**
   - **Step 9.1: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task. This should include the task name, a summary of changes, a list of all created/modified files, and the core "why" for the change.
   - **Step 9.2: Save Summary:** Save this summary locally (e.g., in a temporary file or internal state) to be attached as a Git Note once the phase commit is created.

10. **Record Task Status:**
    - **Step 10.1: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, and update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`.
    - **Step 10.2: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

11. **Stage Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1. **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2. **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
    - **Step 2.1: Determine Phase Scope:** To identify the files changed in this phase, you must first find the starting point. Read `plan.md` to find the Git commit SHA of the *previous* phase's checkpoint. If no previous checkpoint exists, the scope is all changes since the first commit.
    - **Step 2.2: List Changed Files:** Execute `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD` to get a precise list of all files modified during this phase.
    - **Step 2.3: Verify and Create Tests:** For each file in the list:
        - **CRITICAL:** First, check its extension. Exclude non-code files (e.g., `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`).
        - For each remaining code file, verify a corresponding test file exists.
        - If a test file is missing, you **must** create one. Before writing the test, **first, analyze other test files in the repository to determine the correct naming convention and testing style.** The new tests **must** validate the functionality described in this phase's tasks (`plan.md`).

3. **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
    - Before execution, you **must** announce the exact shell command you will use to run the tests.
    - **Example Announcement:** "I will now run the automated test suite to verify the phase. **Command:** `CI=true npm test`"
    - Execute the announced command.
    - If tests fail, you **must** inform the user and begin debugging. You may attempt to propose a fix a **maximum of two times**. If the tests still fail after your second proposed fix, you **must stop**, report the persistent failure, and ask the user for guidance.

4. **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan:**
    - **CRITICAL:** To generate the plan, first analyze `product.md`, `product-guidelines.md`, and `plan.md` to determine the user-facing goals of the completed phase.
    - You **must** generate a step-by-step plan that walks the user through the verification process, including any necessary commands and specific, expected outcomes.
    - The plan you present to the user **must** follow this format:

        **For a Frontend Change:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Start the development server with the command:** `npm run dev`
        2.  **Open your browser to:** `http://localhost:3000`
        3.  **Confirm that you see:** The new user profile page, with the user's name and email displayed correctly.
        ```

        **For a Backend Change:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Ensure the server is running.**
        2.  **Execute the following command in your terminal:** `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users -d '{"name": "test"}'`
        3.  **Confirm that you receive:** A JSON response with a status of `201 Created`.
        ```

5. **Await Explicit User Feedback:**
    - After presenting the detailed plan, ask the user for confirmation: "**Does this meet your expectations? Please confirm with yes or provide feedback on what needs to be changed.**"
    - **PAUSE** and await the user's response. Do not proceed without an explicit yes or confirmation.

6. **Create Phase Commit:**
    - Stage all remaining changes.
    - Perform a single commit for the entire phase with a message like `feat(phase): Complete Phase <Phase Name>`.

7. **Attach Task Summaries and Verification Report:**
    - **Step 7.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-created phase commit*.
    - **Step 7.2: Attach Summaries:** Attach all drafted task summaries from the phase to this commit using `git notes`.
    - **Step 7.3: Attach Verification Report:** Append the verification report (test results, manual verification steps, user confirmation) to the git notes for the same commit.

8. **Record Phase Checkpoint and Task SHAs:**
    - **Step 8.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the phase commit.
    - **Step 8.2: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`.
    - **Step 8.3: Update Phase Heading:** Update the phase heading with the checkpoint SHA in the format `[checkpoint: <sha>]`.
    - **Step 8.4: Update Task SHAs:** Update all tasks completed in this phase with the same 7-character SHA.
    - **Step 8.5: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

9. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage and commit the modified `plan.md` file with a message like `conductor(plan): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`.

10. **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created, with the detailed verification report attached as a git note.
